Associated to every closed, embedded submanifold $N$ of a connected Riemannian manifold $M$, there is the distance function $d_N$ which measures the distance of a point in $M$ from $N$. We analyze the square of this function and show that it is Morse-Bott on the complement of the cut locus $\cutn$ of $N$, provided $M$ is complete. Moreover, the gradient flow lines provide a deformation retraction of $M-\cutn$ to $N$. If $M$ is a closed manifold, then we prove that the Thom space of the normal bundle of $N$ is homeomorphic to $M/\cutn$. We also discuss several interesting results which are either applications of these or related observations regarding the theory of cut locus. These results include, but are not limited to, a computation of the local homology of singular matrices, a classification of the homotopy type of the cut locus of a homology sphere inside a sphere, a deformation of the indefinite unitary group $U(p,q)$ to $U(p)\times U(q)$ and a geometric deformation of $GL(n,\R)$ to $O(n,\R)$ which is different from the Gram-Schmidt retraction.

\noindent If a compact Lie group $G$ acts on a Riemannian manifold $M$ freely then $M/G$ is a manifold. In addition, if the action is isometric, then the metric of $M$ induces a metric on $M/G$.  We show that if $N$ is a $G$-invariant submanifold of $M$, then the cut locus $\cutn$ is $G$-invariant, and $\cutn/G = \cutn[N/G]$ in $M/G$. An application of this result to complex projective hypersurfaces has been provided.
